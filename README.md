#The PageRank algorithm code works by just being run. The initial matrix and vector can be substituted to fit the problem.
#The PCA code requires the use of data.csv
#The least_squares code works by being run. The X, prices, and new_data matrix can be customized.
#The gradient code takes any input of matrices X and A, threshold, and max iterations values. The loss function and gradient functions can also be customized.
